Astrometry.net code release 0.2
===============================
Copyright 2006-2008 Michael Blanton, David W. Hogg, Dustin Lang, Keir Mierle
and Sam Roweis.

   This code is meant as an accompanyment for an upcoming paper and its main
   purpose is to allow reproduction of the results in that paper.

   This is research code only and is not intended for scientific use in reducing
   data or other analyses.

   This release includes a snapshot of all of the components of our current
   research code, including routines to:
     * Convert raw USNO-B and Tycho2 into FITS format for easier use
     * Uniformize, deduplicate, and cut the FITSified catalogs
     * Build indices from these cuts
     * Solve the astrometry of images using these indices

   The code includes:
     * A simple but powerful HEALPIX implementation
     * The QFITS library with several modifications
     * libkd, a compact and high-performance kdtree library

   In principle, the code in the tarball is sufficient to reproduce our entire
   astrometry system and replicate our blind astrometry results (e.g. on the
   SDSS fields).  However, this requires the entire USNO-B 1.0 catalogue which
   is about 80GB in size.  For ease of use, we are distributing our pre-cooked
   indices (about 25 GB total), which are the same files we're using for our
   web service.

INSTALLING
----------

   To compile everything and run with full functionality, you will need:
      * gcc
      * cairo
      * netpbm
      * libpng
      * libjpeg
      * python (probably >= 2.4)
      * numpy

   On Ubuntu or Debian-like systems, the following should suffice:
      $ sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libnetpbm10-dev netpbm \
             libpng12-dev libjpeg-dev python-numpy

   If you don't have and can't get these libraries, you should still be able to
   compile and use the core parts of the solver, but you will miss out on some
   eye-candy.

   Grab the code:
      $ wget http://astrometry.net/downloads/astrometry.net-0.2.tar.bz2
      $ tar xjf astrometry.net-0.2.tar.bz2
      $ cd astrometry.net-0.2

   Build the solving system:
      $ make

   If you installed the libraries listed above, build the plotting code:
      $ make extra

   Install it:
      $ make install

   By default it will be installed in  /usr/local/astrometry .
   You can override this by either:
        * editing the top-level Makefile (look for INSTALL_DIR)
     or * defining INSTALL_DIR on the command-line:
           For bash shell:
             $ export INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/astrometry
             $ make install
           or
             $ INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/astrometry make install
           For tcsh shell:
             $ setenv INSTALL_DIR /path/to/astrometry
             $ make install

   The astrometry solver is composed of several executables.  You may want to add
   the INSTALL_DIR/bin directory to your path:
      For bash shell:
        $ export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/astrometry/bin"
      For tcsh shell:
        $ setenv PATH "$PATH:/usr/local/astrometry/bin"


   Next, grab some pre-cooked indices.  See the file GETTING-INDICES for details
   about how to do this.

   (If you have indices from a previous version of the Astrometry.net software,
    see the "Upgrading" section below.)

   Each index is designed to solve images within a narrow range of scales.  The
   indices designed to solve small (angular size) images are rather large files,
   so you probably only want to grab the indices required for the images you 
   wish to solve.  If you grab extra indices, the solver will run more slowly,
   but the results should be the same.

   Each index contains a large number of "skymarks" (landmarks for the sky) that
   allow our solver to identify your images.  The skymarks contained in each index
   have sizes (diameters) within a narrow range.  You probably want to download
   indices whose quads are, say, 10% to 100% of the sizes of the images you want to
   solve.

   For example, let's say you have some 1-degree square images.  You should grab
   indices that contain skymarks of size 0.1 to 1 degree, or 6 to 60 arcminutes.
   Referring to the table below, you should grab indices 203 through 209.  You
   might find that the same number of fields solve, and faster, using just one or
   two of the indices in the middle of that range - in our example you might try
   205, 206 and 207.

   For reference, we used index 202 alone for our SDSS tests (13x9 arcmin fields).

   index-205.tar.bz2            11  -   16                   526
   index-204.tar.bz2             8  -   11                 1,023
   index-203.tar.bz2             5.6  -  8.0               2,089
   index-202.tar.bz2             4.0  -  5.6               4,260
   index-201.tar.bz2             2.8  -  4.0               5,878
   index-200.tar.bz2             2.0  -  2.8              10,058
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   Download the indices you need and put them in the top-level (astrometry-0.2)
   directory.

   Install them:
      $ make install-indices

   (Or you can extract them into the INSTALL_DIR/data directory by hand.)


   Next, you can (optionally) configure the solver by editing the file
      INSTALL_DIR/etc/backend.cfg



   Finally, solve some fields.

   (If you didn't build the plotting commands, add "--no-plots" to the command
    lines below.)

     If you have any of indices 213 to 218:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 10 demo/apod4.jpg

     If you have index 219:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 30 demo/apod5.jpg

     If you have any of indices 210 to 214:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 1 demo/apod3.jpg

     If you have any of indices 206 to 211:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 1 demo/apod2.jpg

     If you have any of indices 203 to 205:
        $ solve-field apod1.jpg

     If you have any of indices 200 to 203:
        $ solve-field demo/sdss.jpg


   Copyrights and credits for the demo images are listed in the file demo/CREDITS .

   Note that you can also give solve-field a URL rather than a file as input:
        $ solve-field --out apod1b http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/ngc2264_croman_c3.jpg 



   If you don't have the netpbm tools (eg jpegtopnm), do this instead:

     If you have any of indices 213 to 218:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 10 demo/apod4.xyls

     If you have index 219:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 30 demo/apod5.xyls

     If you have any of indices 210 to 214:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 1 demo/apod3.xyls

     If you have any of indices 206 to 211:
        $ solve-field --scale-low 1 demo/apod2.xyls

     If you have any of indices 203 to 205:
        $ solve-field demo/apod1.xyls

     If you have any of indices 200 to 203:
        $ solve-field demo/sdss.xyls




   Each of these commands should solve the field and produce a number of output
   files:
       sdss-ngc.png : an annotation of the image.
       sdss.wcs : a FITS WCS header for the solution.
       sdss-objs.png : a plot of the sources (stars) we extracted from the image.
       sdss-indx.png : sources (red), plus stars from the index (green), plus the
                       skymark ("quad") used to solve the image.
       sdss-indx.xyls : a FITS BINTABLE with the pixel locations of stars from the index.
       sdss.rdls : a FITS BINTABLE with the RA,Dec of sources we extracted from the image.
       sdss.axy : a FITS BINTABLE of the sources we extracted, plus headers that
                  describe the job (how the image is going to be solved).
       sdss.solved : contains binary 1 if the field solved.
       sdss.match : a FITS BINTABLE describing the quad match that solved the image.


UPGRADING
---------
  The format of the index files has changed from the 0.1 and 0.11 releases.
  There is a program for updating them, and there is also a makefile target.

    $ make upgrade-indices


SOLVE-FIELDS ARGUMENTS
----------------------
   There are a few command-line arguments to solve-fields that are very important
   in determining how quickly it runs:

  * CPU time limit before giving up:
      solve-field --cpu-limit 30 ...
    will make it give up after 30 seconds.

  * Scale of the image: if you provide bounds (lower and upper limits) on the size
    of the image you are trying to solve, solving can be much faster.  In the last
    examples above, for example, we specified that the field is at least 30 degrees
    wide: this means that we don't need to search for matches in the indices that
    contain only tiny skymarks.

    Eg, to specify that the image is between 1 and 2 degrees wide:
      solve-field --scale-units degwidth --scale-low 1 --scale-high 2

    If you know the pixel scale instead:
      solve-field --scale-units arcsecperpix --scale-low 0.386 --scale-high 0.406


  * Depth.  The solver works by looking at sources in your image, starting with the
    brightest.  It searches for all "skymarks" that can be built from the N brightest
    stars before considering star N+1.  When using several indices, it can be much
    faster to search for many skymarks in one index before switching to the next one.
    This flag lets you control when the solver switches between indices.  It also lets
    you control how much effort the solver puts in before giving up - by default it
    looks at all the sources in your image, and this can take a ridiculously long time
    for many images.

    Eg, to first look at sources 0-20 in all indices, then sources 20-30 in all indices,
    then 30-40:
       solve-field --depth 0-20,20-30,30-40
    or solve-field --depth 0-20 --depth 20-30 --depth 30-40

    Note that sources are numbered starting at zero.  Yes, we're computer science geeks.


XYLISTS
-------
   The solve-field program accepts either images or "xylists" (xyls), which are just
   FITS BINTABLE files which contain two columns (float or double (E or D) format)
   which list the pixel coordinates of sources (stars, etc) in the image.

   To specify the column names (eg, "XIMAGE" and "YIMAGE"):
      solve-field --x-column XIMAGE --y-column YIMAGE

   Our solver assumes that the sources are listed in order of brightness, with the
   brightest sources first.  If your files aren't sorted, you can specify a column by
   which the file should be sorted.
      solve-field --sort-column FLUX

   By default it sorts with the largest value first (so it works correctly if the
   column contains FLUX values), but you can reverse that by:
      solve-field --sort-ascending --sort-column MAG

   When using xylists, you should also specify the original width and height of the
   image, in pixels:
      solve-field --width 2000 --height 1500

   Alternatively, if the FITS header contains "IMAGEW" and "IMAGEH" keys, these will be
   used.

   The solver can deal with multi-extension xylists; indeed, this is a convenient way
   to solve a large number of fields at once.  You can tell it which extensions it
   should solve by:
      solve-field --fields 1-100,120,130-200

   (Ranges of fields are inclusive, and the first FITS extension is 1, as per the FITS
    standard.)

   Unfortunately, the plotting code isn't smart about handling multiple fields, so
   if you're using multi-extension xylists you probably want to turn off plotting:
      solve-field --no-plots


TRICKS AND TIPS
---------------
   Say you've got a directory full of FITS images from your latest observing run,
   and you just want them calibrated NOW.

   > ls data/
   .   AISCHV2_037_08859_0001_sv01-nd-int.fits.gz  AISCHV2_040_19670_0001_sv02-nd-int.fits.gz
   ..  AISCHV2_040_19670_0001_sv01-nd-int.fits.gz

   > time solve-field data/*

   Okay, that worked but it was really slow.  Annoyingly, it takes a long time to decide that
   an image isn't going to solve.  You can reduce that time:

   > solve-field --cpulimit 30 ...

   Alternatively, you can force it to only look at the brightest N sources in your images:

   > solve-field --depth 1-20 ...



SOURCE EXTRACTION USING SEXTRACTOR
----------------------------------
   http://terapix.iap.fr/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=91/

   The "Source Extractor" aka "SExtractor" program by Emmanuel Bertin can be used to do
   source extraction if you don't want to use our own bundled "image2xy" program.

   You can use the following configuration entries to produce an "xylist" which can be
   fed to solve-field:

   CATALOG_TYPE     FITS_1.0
   # this is the output filename:
   CATALOG_NAME     out.xyls
   PARAMETERS_NAME  xylist.param

   In the file "xylist.param", include:

   X_IMAGE
   Y_IMAGE
   MAG_ISO
   # or MAG_ISOCOR or MAG_AUTO

   After running SExtractor on your image, you can feed the resulting file straight to
   solve-field:
      solve-field out.xyls --x-column X_IMAGE --y-column Y_IMAGE --sort-column MAG_ISO
                  --sort-ascending --overwrite --width 496 --height 340


WORKAROUNDS
-----------

   No python
   ---------
   There are two places we use python: handling images, and filtering FITS files.

   You can avoid the image-handling code by doing source extraction yourself; see the
   "No netpbm" section below.

   You can avoid filtering FITS files by using the "--no-fits2fits" option to
   solve-field.

   No netpbm
   ---------
   We use the netpbm tools (jpegtopnm, pnmtofits, etc) to convert from all sorts of
   image formats to PNM and FITS.

   If you don't have these programs installed, you must do source extraction yourself
   and use "xylists" rather than images as the input to solve-field.  See SEXTRACTOR
   and XYLIST sections above.


UNDER THE HOOD
--------------
   Because we also operate a web service using most of the same software, the local
   version of the solver is a bit more complicated than it really needs to be.  The
   "solve-field" program takes your input files, does source extraction on them to
   produce an "xylist" -- a FITS BINTABLE of source positions -- then takes the
   information you supplied about your fields on the command-line and adds FITS
   headers encoding this information.  We call this file an "augmented xylist"; we
   use the filename suffix ".axy".  "solve-field" then calls the "backend" program,
   passing it your axy file.  "backend" reads a config file (by default
   /usr/local/astrometry/etc/backend.cfg) that describes things like where to find
   index files, whether to load all the indexes at once or run them one at a time,
   how long to spend on each field, and so on.  If you want to force only a certain
   set of indices to load, you can copy the backend.cfg file to a local version and
   change the list of indices that are loaded, and then tell solve-field to use this
   config file:
      solve-field --backend-config mybackend.cfg ...
