<h2>About the API</h2>
<p>
    Astrometry.net allows you to access most parts of the service through a JSON API.
    This API allows you to upload images, check job and submission statuses, and
    retrieve all those useful bits of data from successfully calibrated fields -
    all programmatically. This means that it's easy to write a script to upload
    hundreds of images, integrate our service into your own website, or even 
    program an application to explore Astrometry.net's data in a unique way. 
    Have fun!
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    Many API calls to retrieve information about existing images can be made
    without permission. For example, you can retrieve the list of annotated
    objects in an image via a URL like <a href="https://nova.astrometry.net/api/jobs/123456/annotations">https://nova.astrometry.net/api/jobs/JOBID/annotations/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>However</b>, in order to protect against web scraper bots driven by the
  so-called "AI" bubble, when downloading files programatically, you must set
  the HTTP request header:
  <pre>
    Referer: https://nova.astrometry.net/api/login
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
    If you want to modify data on the site, you need to grab an <u>API key</u> first.
    This is a randomly generated string tied to your user account; everything
    you do using the API will be through your account on the Astrometry.net
    web service (e.g. any API uploads will show up on your web profile).
</p>
<p>
    Your key is available in the My Profile section of the dashboard,
    {% if user.is_authenticated %} 
        but here it is for convenience:<br />
        <span style="margin-left:20px">
            {% include 'user/api_key.html' with apikey=user_profile.apikey %}
        </span><br />
	{% comment %}
	<form action="{% url 'new_api_key' %}">
	  You can also <input type="submit" value="Generate a new API key" />
	</form>
	<br />
	{% endcomment %}
    {% else %}
        so you must first
        <a href="{% url 'signin' %}?next={{ request.path }}">Sign In</a>.

    {% endif %}

</p>

<p>
Then head on over to the
<a href="https://astrometry.net/doc/net/api.html">API Documentation</a>, such as it is.

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>
If you speak python, probably the best documentation for the API is our complete implementation of a client:
<a href="https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net/blob/master/net/client/client.py">API client code</a>
<br />
Which you can check out by cloning the Astrometry.net repo and looking in the astrometry/net/client directory;
<pre>git clone https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net.git</pre>
or <a href="https://github.com/dstndstn/astrometry.net/tree/main/net/client">On Github</a>
</p>

<p>
There is also
some <a href="https://github.com/ckleinastro/pairitel_reduction_pipeline/blob/master/anet.py">contributed
code from Christopher Klein</a>, used for the PAIRITEL telescope data
analysis, which runs SourceExtractor and submits a text list of x,y coordinates.
