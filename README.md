Astrometry.net
==============

Automatic recognition of astronomical images; or standards-compliant
astrometric metadata from data.

Latest release: http://astrometry.net/downloads/astrometry.net-0.50pre.tar.gz

> If you have astronomical imaging of the sky with celestial coordinates
> you do not know—or do not trust—then Astrometry.net is for you. Input
> an image and we'll give you back astrometric calibration meta-data,
> plus lists of known objects falling inside the field of view.

> We have built this astrometric calibration service to create correct,
> standards-compliant astrometric meta-data for every useful
> astronomical image ever taken, past and future, in any state of
> archival disarray. We hope this will help organize, annotate and make
> searchable all the world's astronomical information.
