 Starting from a "seed" or list of "seeds" healpixes, grows a region
 by looking at healpix neighbours.  Accepts healpixes for which the
 "accept" function returns 1.  Returns the healpixes that are
 accepted.  The accepted results are placed in "accepted", if
 non-NULL, or in a newly-allocated list.

 If "rejected" is non-NULL, the healpixes that are rejected will be
 put there.

 If "depth" is non-zero, that number of neighbour steps will be taken.
 Zero means no limit.

 NOTE that any existing entries in the "accepted" list will be treated
 as having already been accepted: when the search reaches them, their
 neighbours will not be added to the frontier to explore.
