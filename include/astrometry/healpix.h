/**
   In this documentation we talk about "base healpixes": these are the big,
   top-level healpixes.  There are 12 of these, with indices [0, 11].

   We say "fine healpixes" or "healpixes" or "pixels" when we mean the fine-
   scale healpixes; there are Nside^2 of these in each base healpix,
   for a total of 12*Nside^2, indexed from zero.
 */

/**
   Some notes about the different indexing schemes:

   The healpix paper discusses two different ways to number healpixes, and
   there is a third way, which we prefer, which is (in my opinion) more
   sensible and easy.


   -RING indexing.  Healpixes are numbered first in order of decreasing DEC,
   then in order of increasing RA of the center of the pixel, ie:

   .       0       1       2       3
   .     4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11
   .  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19
   .    20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27
   .  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35
   .    36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43
   .      44      45      46      47

   Note that 12, 20 and 28 are part of base healpix 4, as is 27; it "wraps
   around".

   The RING index can be decomposed into the "ring number" and the index
   within the ring (called "longitude index").  Note that different rings
   contain different numbers of healpixes.  Also note that the ring number
   starts from 1, but the longitude index starts from zero.


   -NESTED indexing.  This only works for Nside parameters that are powers of
   two.  This scheme is hierarchical in the sense that each pair of bits of
   the index tells you where the pixel center is to finer and finer
   resolution.  It doesn't really show with Nside=2, but here it is anyway:

   .       3       7      11      15
   .     2   1   6   5  10   9  14  13
   .  19   0  23   4  27   8  31  12
   .    17  22  21  26  25  30  29  18
   .  16  35  20  39  24  43  28  47
   .    34  33  38  37  42  41  46  45
   .      32      36      40      44

   Note that all the base healpixes have the same pattern; they're just
   offset by factors of Nside^2.

   Here's a zoom-in of the first base healpix, turned 45 degrees to the
   right, for Nside=4:

   .   10  11  14  15
   .    8   9  12  13
   .    2   3   6   7
   .    0   1   4   5

   Note that the bottom-left block of 4 have the smallest values, and within
   that the bottom-left corner has the smallest value, followed by the
   bottom-right, top-left, then top-right.

   The NESTED index can't be decomposed into 'orthogonal' directions.


   -XY indexing.  This is arguably the most natural, at least for the
   internal usage of the healpix code.  Within each base healpix, the
   healpixes are numbered starting with 0 for the southmost pixel, then
   increasing first in the "y" (north-west), then in the "x" (north-east)
   direction.  In other words, within each base healpix there is a grid
   and we number the pixels "lexicographically" (mod a 135 degree turn).

   .       3       7      11      15
   .     1   2   5   6   9  10  13  14
   .  19   0  23   4  27   8  31  12
   .    18  21  22  25  26  29  30  17
   .  16  35  20  39  24  43  28  47
   .    33  34  37  38  41  42  45  46
   .      32      36      40      44

   Zooming in on the first base healpix, turning 45 degrees to the right,
   for Nside=4 we get:

   .    3   7  11  15
   .    2   6  10  14
   .    1   5   9  13
   .    0   4   8  12

   Notice that the numbers first increase from bottom to top (y), then left to
   right (x).

   The XY indexing can be decomposed into 'x' and 'y' coordinates
   (in case that wasn't obvious), where the above figure becomes (x,y):

   .    (0,3)  (1,3)  (2,3)  (3,3)
   .    (0,2)  (1,2)  (2,2)  (3,2)
   .    (0,1)  (1,1)  (2,1)  (3,1)
   .    (0,0)  (1,0)  (2,0)  (3,0)

   Note that "x" increases in the north-east direction, and "y" increases in
   the north-west direction.

   The major advantage to this indexing scheme is that it extends to
   fractional coordinates in a natural way: it is meaningful to talk about
   the position (x,y) = (0.25, 0.6) and you can compute its position.




   In this code, all healpix indexing uses the XY scheme.  If you want to
   use the other schemes you will have to use the conversion routines:
   .   healpix_xy_to_ring
   .   healpix_ring_to_xy
   .   healpix_xy_to_nested
   .   healpix_nested_to_xy
