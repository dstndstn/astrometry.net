/**

 Given a FITS BINTABLE, select a (permuted) subset of the rows that
 yields a spatially uniform, bright, catalog.

 Works by laying a healpix grid over the sky and selecting N stars in
 each healpixel (grid cell).  In other words, sweep over the
 healpixes, first selecting the brightest star, then the second
 brightest, etc.

 healpix = -1: make all-sky index.


 FIXME -- the following is currently NOT TRUE -- do we need it?
 Within each sweep, the brightness ordering will be
 used, so that when you list the catalog you will see the stars
 collected during the first sweep, sorted by brightness, then the
 stars from the second sweep, also sorted by brightness.  Note that
 the brightest star in the second sweep may be brighter than the
 faintest star in the first sweep: spatial uniformity trumps
 brightness.
