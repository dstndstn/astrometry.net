 This code allows easy access to the Henry Draper catalog stored in
 kd-tree format.  Get the required hd.fits file either by the easy way:

 wget http://trac.astrometry.net/export/13120/binary/henry-draper/hd.fits

 Or the hard way (which involves downloading > 500 MB of Tycho-2 catalog from Denmark!):

 make hd.fits   (in the astrometry.net catalog/ directory)
