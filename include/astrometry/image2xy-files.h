/**
 Reads an input FITS image (possibly multi-HDU), runs simplexy on each
 image and places the results in an output file containing a FITS BINTABLE.

 If you want to look at just a single HDU, set "extension".  Note
 that it follows the QFITS convention that the primary extension is 0,
 the first extension is 1, etc.  This is different than the CFITSIO
 convention which is 1-based: 1 is the primary extension, 2 is the
 first extension, etc.
