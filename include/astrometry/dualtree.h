   Dual-tree search.

   Input:
   -a search tree
   -a query tree
   -a function that takes two nodes and returns true if the result set should
   contain that pair of nodes.
   -an extra value that will be passed to the decision function.
   -a function that is called for each pair of leaf nodes.
   (** actually, at least one of the nodes will be a leaf. **)
   -an extra value that will be passed to the leaf-node function

   The query tree is a kd-tree built out of the points you want to query.

   The search and query trees can be the same tree.
